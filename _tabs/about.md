Hello, I'm Petru Dolhescu, an experienced .NET Developer with 6 years in the field. Recently, I've expanded my expertise into DevOps technologies, including Kubernetes and Terraform. Recognizing the diverse nature of my tech skills, I've transitioned from titling myself exclusively as a ".NET Developer" to adopting a more encompassing title: Software Engineer.

My passion for work extends to technical writing, and in moments without a PC, I immerse myself in books on communication, self-improvement, and financial literacy. Outside the realms of technology and literature, you'll often find me trekking. A notable accomplishment is conquering the Ridge of Fagaras Mountains, covering a distance of 70 km in a straight line.

Feel free to stay here if you share a joy in reading about technology and beyond.
