Hello,

It's time to say goodbye to my old pal Blogger, a platform I've used since my high school days over a decade ago. Now, I'm starting a new chapter with a static website for my tech blog, a perfect fit for what's next.

Excited to introduce you to my new tech blog, where I'll soon be sharing practical tech insights. Meanwhile, you can check out my past tech articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@petrudolhescu). In the future, this space will be my main online home.

Stay tuned for awesome tech insights coming your way.

And a big thank you to GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and the Chirpy theme for making building a static website so easy and free.

Cheers!
